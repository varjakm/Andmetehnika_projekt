Software information, only a single code file: 'projekt.ipynb'
1) The code was written in *.ipynb format using Visual Studio Code, ver. 1.79.0
2) The code is running on Python, ver. 3.11.3
3) Necessary additional libraries for the project are:
requests - to carry out web requests
pandas - to handle dataframes
numpy - for mathemicals operations
zipfile - to handle zip files
matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn together for visualization
And os to manage folders and files
If required, '%pip install <library>' command will get the library downloaded and installed, currently commented out

Running the program will lead to download of files from:
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator
More specifically:
i) GDP per capita:     https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD?downloadformat=csv

ii) Life expectancy:    https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN?downloadformat=csv

iii) Literacy:           https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/SE.ADT.LITR.ZS?downloadformat=csv

Additional file is download for countries and their (sub)-regions:
https://github.com/lukes/ISO-3166-Countries-with-Regional-Codes/raw/master/all/all.csv


Running the program requires no input from the user, all the necessary files are downloaded, unzipped if needed and
converted to dataframes using Pandas library. Pandas is also used to handle dataframes to produce inputs for visualization.
Visualizations done with Matlplotlib and its expansion Seaborn.


However, no code is for Microsoft PowerBI, Version: 2.117.984.0 64-bit (May 2023), this process was done to 
demonstrate a different and more powerful visualization tool that can be used for data. The same files that were used
with Python, were also used for PowerBI. Short description for PowerBI usage has been given in ReadME file. We also
provide a PowerBI file itself: AndmetehnikaProjekt.pbix. Its usage requires properiarty software and purchase of the
lisense. Its results can be seen here:
